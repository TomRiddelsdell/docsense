# Smart Beta ESG Index

## 1. Index Objective

The Smart Beta ESG Index aims to provide exposure to companies with strong ESG profiles while maintaining similar risk characteristics to the parent index.

## 2. Eligibility Criteria

Stocks must meet the following criteria:
- Market capitalization above the minimum threshold
- Average daily trading volume above the liquidity threshold
- ESG score above the minimum acceptable level
- Not on the exclusion list

## 3. ESG Scoring

ESG scores are obtained from a leading third-party provider. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better ESG performance.

The minimum score threshold is set at a level that excludes approximately the bottom quartile of stocks.

## 4. Weighting Scheme

Stocks are weighted using a modified market capitalization approach:
- Base weight = Market cap weight
- ESG tilt = Applied based on relative ESG score
- Concentration limits apply

The maximum weight for any single stock is capped at an appropriate level.

## 5. Rebalancing

The index is rebalanced periodically. The rebalancing frequency balances tracking error considerations with transaction costs.

Additions and deletions are subject to buffer rules to reduce unnecessary turnover.

## 6. Exclusions

Certain industries and activities are excluded:
- Controversial weapons (as commonly defined)
- Companies failing UN Global Compact principles
- Companies with significant exposure to excluded activities

## 7. Corporate Actions

Corporate actions are handled in a manner consistent with general market practice for equity indices.

## 8. Risk Controls

Sector weights are constrained relative to the parent index. The tracking error budget is managed appropriately.
