# Glossary - Ubiquitous Language

This glossary defines the ubiquitous language used throughout the Trading Algorithm Document Analyzer application. All team members, documentation, and code should use these terms consistently.

## Domain Terms

### Document

A file containing a trading algorithm description, strategy, or specification. Documents are the primary entity that users upload, analyze, and modify.

### Trading Algorithm

A systematic set of rules and procedures for executing trades in financial markets. Documents describe these algorithms in human-readable form.

### Feedback

Suggestions generated by the AI Agent for improving a document. Each piece of feedback targets a specific section and includes an explanation and proposed change.

### Suggestion

A specific recommended change to a document section. Synonymous with "feedback item" in the context of AI-generated recommendations.

### Change

A modification to a document. Changes can be:
- **Accepted**: The user approved the suggestion and it was applied
- **Rejected**: The user declined the suggestion
- **Pending**: The suggestion is awaiting user decision

### Version

A snapshot of a document at a specific point in time. Versions are created when documents are uploaded, when changes are applied, and when documents are exported.

### Audit Trail

The complete, immutable history of all actions taken on a document, including uploads, analyses, accepted changes, rejected changes, and exports.

## Technical Terms (DDD/Event Sourcing/CQRS)

### Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. In this system:
- **Document Aggregate**: Manages document state and versions
- **FeedbackSession Aggregate**: Manages analysis sessions and suggestions
- **AuditTrail Aggregate**: Manages audit log entries

### Aggregate Root

The main entity in an aggregate that controls access to other entities within it. External objects can only reference the aggregate root.

### Bounded Context

A logical boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. Our contexts include:
- **Document Management**: Upload, storage, versioning
- **Analysis**: AI-powered document analysis
- **Feedback Management**: Suggestion handling and decisions
- **Audit**: Event tracking and history

### Command

An instruction to perform an action that may change state. Commands are named imperatively:
- UploadDocument
- AnalyzeDocument
- AcceptChange
- RejectChange
- ExportDocument

### Event

An immutable record of something that happened in the system. Events are named in past tense:
- DocumentUploaded
- DocumentConverted
- DocumentAnalyzed
- FeedbackGenerated
- ChangeAccepted
- ChangeRejected
- DocumentExported

### Event Store

The persistent storage for all domain events. The event store is append-only and serves as the source of truth for system state.

### Projection

A read model built by processing events. Projections are optimized for specific query patterns:
- **DocumentView**: Current document state for display
- **FeedbackView**: Pending feedback items
- **AuditLogView**: Chronological audit entries
- **VersionHistoryView**: Document version timeline

### Read Model

A denormalized data structure optimized for queries. Built from projections of events.

### Write Model

The domain model used for processing commands and generating events.

## User Interface Terms

### Upload Panel

The interface component where users select and upload documents.

### Analysis View

The interface showing AI-generated feedback with options to accept or reject.

### Diff View

Side-by-side comparison showing original text and suggested changes.

### Version Timeline

Visual representation of document version history.

### Export Dialog

Interface for selecting export format and initiating download.

## API Terms

### Endpoint

A specific URL path in the REST API that handles requests.

### Resource

A domain entity exposed through the API (documents, feedback, versions).

### Request/Response

The data sent to and received from API endpoints.

## AI Agent Terms

### Agent

The AI system powered by Google Agent Development Kit that analyzes documents and generates feedback.

### Analysis Session

A single run of the AI agent against a document. Sessions are tracked for auditing.

### Prompt

The instruction set given to the AI agent to guide its analysis.

### Confidence Score

A measure (0-1) of how confident the agent is in a particular suggestion.
