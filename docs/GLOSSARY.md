# Glossary - Ubiquitous Language

This glossary defines the ubiquitous language used throughout the Trading Algorithm Document Analyzer application. All team members, documentation, and code should use these terms consistently.

## Domain Terms

### Document

A file containing a trading algorithm description, strategy, or specification. Documents are the primary entity that users upload, analyze, and modify.

### Trading Algorithm

A systematic set of rules and procedures for executing trades in financial markets. Documents describe these algorithms in human-readable form.

### Feedback

Suggestions generated by the AI Agent for improving a document. Each piece of feedback targets a specific section and includes an explanation and proposed change.

### Suggestion

A specific recommended change to a document section. Synonymous with "feedback item" in the context of AI-generated recommendations.

### Change

A modification to a document. Changes can be:
- **Accepted**: The user approved the suggestion and it was applied
- **Rejected**: The user declined the suggestion
- **Pending**: The suggestion is awaiting user decision

### Version

A snapshot of a document at a specific point in time. Versions are created when documents are uploaded, when changes are applied, and when documents are exported.

### Audit Trail

The complete, immutable history of all actions taken on a document, including uploads, analyses, accepted changes, rejected changes, and exports.

## Technical Terms (DDD/Event Sourcing/CQRS)

### Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. In this system:
- **Document Aggregate**: Manages document state and versions
- **FeedbackSession Aggregate**: Manages analysis sessions and suggestions
- **AuditTrail Aggregate**: Manages audit log entries

### Aggregate Root

The main entity in an aggregate that controls access to other entities within it. External objects can only reference the aggregate root.

### Bounded Context

A logical boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. Our contexts include:
- **Document Management**: Upload, storage, versioning
- **Analysis**: AI-powered document analysis
- **Feedback Management**: Suggestion handling and decisions
- **Audit**: Event tracking and history

### Command

An instruction to perform an action that may change state. Commands are named imperatively:
- UploadDocument
- AnalyzeDocument
- AcceptChange
- RejectChange
- ExportDocument

### Event

An immutable record of something that happened in the system. Events are named in past tense:
- DocumentUploaded
- DocumentConverted
- DocumentAnalyzed
- FeedbackGenerated
- ChangeAccepted
- ChangeRejected
- DocumentExported

### Event Store

The persistent storage for all domain events. The event store is append-only and serves as the source of truth for system state.

### Projection

A read model built by processing events. Projections are optimized for specific query patterns:
- **DocumentView**: Current document state for display
- **FeedbackView**: Pending feedback items
- **AuditLogView**: Chronological audit entries
- **VersionHistoryView**: Document version timeline

### Read Model

A denormalized data structure optimized for queries. Built from projections of events.

### Write Model

The domain model used for processing commands and generating events.

## User Interface Terms

### Upload Panel

The interface component where users select and upload documents.

### Analysis View

The interface showing AI-generated feedback with options to accept or reject.

### Diff View

Side-by-side comparison showing original text and suggested changes.

### Version Timeline

Visual representation of document version history.

### Export Dialog

Interface for selecting export format and initiating download.

## API Terms

### Endpoint

A specific URL path in the REST API that handles requests.

### Resource

A domain entity exposed through the API (documents, feedback, versions).

### Request/Response

The data sent to and received from API endpoints.

## AI Agent Terms

### Agent

The AI system that analyzes documents and generates feedback. The system supports multiple AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) through a model abstraction layer, enabling provider selection based on task requirements and data sensitivity.

### Analysis Session

A single run of the AI agent against a document. Sessions are tracked for auditing.

### Prompt

The instruction set given to the AI agent to guide its analysis.

### Confidence Score

A measure (0-1) of how confident the agent is in a particular suggestion.

### Model Provider

An AI model service (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) that performs document analysis. The system supports multiple providers through an abstraction layer.

## Policy and Compliance Terms

### Policy Repository

A named collection of policies that define regulatory, compliance, or organizational requirements for documents. Documents are assigned to a Policy Repository to determine which rules apply during analysis.

Examples:
- "SEC Index Publishing" - regulatory requirements for index methodology documents
- "Internal Algo Standard" - organizational documentation standards

### Policy

A single rule or requirement within a Policy Repository. Policies specify what a document MUST, SHOULD, or MAY contain.

### Requirement Type

Classification of policy strictness:
- **MUST**: Mandatory requirement; non-compliance is a violation
- **SHOULD**: Recommended; non-compliance triggers a warning
- **MAY**: Optional; presence is noted but absence is acceptable

### Compliance Status

The state of a document relative to its assigned Policy Repository:
- **PENDING**: Not yet analyzed against policies
- **COMPLIANT**: Meets all MUST requirements
- **PARTIAL**: Meets some but not all MUST requirements
- **NON_COMPLIANT**: Fails critical MUST requirements

### Document Policy Assignment

The association between a Document and a Policy Repository, enabling policy-aware analysis.

### Validation Rule

A specific check within a Policy that the AI performs during analysis. Rules can check for required sections, content patterns, formatting requirements, etc.

## Document Processing Terms

### Canonical Format

The standardized internal format (Markdown with metadata) to which all uploaded documents are converted before AI analysis.

### Document Converter

A component that transforms input formats (Word, PDF, RST, Markdown) into the canonical format while preserving structure.

### Page Limit

The maximum document size supported for analysis. Currently 100 pages.

## Self-Containment Terms

### Self-Containment

The property of a document (or document set) being complete enough that an independent person can fully implement the described trading strategy using only the uploaded documentation, without requiring external references or making assumptions.

### Self-Containment Score

A numeric measure (0.0-1.0) indicating how well a document meets self-containment requirements. A score of 1.0 indicates full self-containment; lower scores indicate missing information.

### Implementability Assessment

An evaluation of whether a document provides sufficient information for independent implementation, including:
- **can_implement_strategy**: Whether the trading strategy can be fully implemented
- **can_calculate_index**: Whether index levels can be exactly reproduced
- **blocking_issues_count**: Number of critical issues preventing implementation
- **assessment_summary**: Narrative summary of implementation readiness

### Missing Document

A document, appendix, or attachment that is referenced within the analyzed document but not included in the submission. Missing documents are categorized by criticality (critical, high, medium).

### Undefined Dependency

An external system, data feed, vendor service, database, or API that is referenced in the document without full specification. Each undefined dependency lists the missing specifications needed for implementation.

### Implementation Gap

A specific piece of missing information that prevents complete implementation of the trading strategy or exact index calculation.

### Issue Categories (Self-Containment)

Categories used to classify self-containment issues:
- **missing_reference**: External document referenced but not included
- **undefined_parameter**: Parameter, threshold, or value mentioned but not defined
- **incomplete_formula**: Formula or calculation missing components
- **ambiguous_methodology**: Process described without implementation detail
- **external_dependency**: Reliance on unspecified external system
- **assumption_required**: Information requiring inference to understand
- **inconsistent_content**: Conflicting information within/across documents
- **missing_governance**: Governance process not fully documented
- **data_source_unspecified**: Data source without full specification
- **compliance_gap**: Regulatory or policy compliance issue

### Zero Tolerance Policy

The principle that document analysis will flag ANY content requiring inference or assumption, with no implicit understanding of market conventions, industry standards, or "obvious" values permitted.

## Document Group Terms

### Document Group

A named collection of related documents that are analyzed together as a single unit for comprehensive self-containment validation. Groups enable cross-document reference checking and combined analysis.

### Primary Document

The main document within a Document Group, typically the core methodology or strategy document that references supporting materials (appendices, manuals, frameworks).

### Member Document

A document that belongs to a Document Group. Documents can belong to multiple groups (useful for shared appendices or common reference materials).

### Group Analysis

The process of analyzing all documents in a group together by concatenating their content and checking cross-document references. Group analysis validates that all referenced materials within the group are present and that the combined documentation is self-contained.

### Group Completeness Status

The state of a Document Group relative to self-containment:
- **PENDING**: Group not yet analyzed
- **COMPLETE**: All cross-document references resolve within the group
- **INCOMPLETE**: Some referenced documents are missing from the group

### Cross-Document Reference

A reference in one document to content in another document (e.g., "See Appendix A" or "as defined in the Governance Framework"). Group analysis validates that these references resolve to actual documents within the group.

## Integration Terms

### API-First

Design approach where all functionality is exposed through the REST API, with the web UI being one of many possible API consumers.

### API Client

Any external system that integrates with the document analyzer through the REST API.
