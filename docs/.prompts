2. Flag gaps in the current documentation that need to be clarified or additional ADRs required
3. Update documentation and ensurmentation and ensure consistency with recent decisions
4. Take a Test Driven Development approach to the implementation
5. Document progress, including test coverge and any architectural assumptions made during the last step and 
6. Review the implementation and document any areas where the implememtation could be improved in terms of:
  a) User satisfaction
  b) Extensibility
